# Bold&Adventurous

This is the Eleventy version of the Bold&Adventurous blog, migrated from Jekyll.

This blog hasn't been active since 2016 - but we are planning a small come back. And I wanted to modernize this site, rather than let it rot. It tells our story, and somehow still gets visits. 

I might migrate one more time to Astro... there are some things I always wanted on this site.

## About

We're a family of 4 with a tiny house & big backyard. Living, working & exploring the USA in our Airstream. Hiking, biking, kayaking, off-roading and enjoying campfires with friends along the way.

We created this blog for you; our trusted friends. To share our stories, adventures and lessons from the road. From the gear we use, to the places we go and the friends we meet along the way.
