We're officially kicking off the countdown to our full-time Airstream adventure!

Come May 1st, 2015, we're ditching the suburban safety net and the 9-to-5 grind for a life on the open road. We're trading our home and most of our possessions for 185 square feet of Airstream freedom, all in pursuit of adventure, simplicity, and personal growth as a family.

Before we hit the highway, though, there are a few checkpoints to tackle. Sure, it feels like there’s a mountain of work—there were days we wished we could just snap our fingers and have it all done. But there’s no magic wand here; it’s all about hard work, grit, and the thrill of making dreams a reality.

We’ve mapped out our “war plan” in three exciting categories: The Airstream, Our Stuff, and what we call “Coverages” (that’s the grown-up side of our adventure).

## The Airstream
Getting our home on wheels ready for the road means prioritizing essentials over dreams we can chase later (like that 400-watt solar setup—patience, friend!). Our current Airstream To-Do List includes:
  
  * 4 new tires + 1 spare  
  * Repack axles  
  * New brakes  
  * Reseal the Airstream & check for leaks  
  * New fan covers  
  * 2 new batteries  
  * Wire the TV  
  * Fix the hole in the floor under the dinette  
  * Lay down new flooring  
  * Complete LTE/Antenna installation and WiFi setup

And we can’t forget a few tweaks for our tow vehicle:
  
  * Transmission fluid change  
  * Front diff fluid change  
  * Front transfer case fluid change  
  * New antenna for LTE/MiFi  

## Our Stuff
We love minimalism, but somehow, our life keeps adding up. So, we're getting into “packing for the Airstream” mode—every item not joining our journey is being sold, donated, or tossed out. Our mission? Clear out the entire house by March 30th to lighten our load and embrace the nomadic lifestyle.

## Coverages
Then there’s the adult stuff: setting up our mailing address, moving our LLC’s, arranging mail forwarding, securing insurance for full-timers, canceling old services, checking investments, sorting out bank details, and even tackling the less-than-thrilling tasks of will planning and end-of-life assurances. Yes, it's boring compared to chasing sunsets, but these essentials keep our adventure running smoothly.

Our goal is to have 99% of this behind us by April 1st—right around the time our second daughter makes her grand entrance. This way, we can welcome her without a mountain of to-do lists shadowing our joy.

**This is our public declaration:** we're making a run for the goal post. Over the next 100 days, we'll be sharing regular updates about our progress—detailing every win, setback, and lesson learned along the way. We hope our journey inspires others to ask, “Can I do this too?” Because sometimes, the wildest adventures begin when you dare to leave everything behind and hit the road.

Here’s to adventure, simplicity, and the courage to follow our dreams!
