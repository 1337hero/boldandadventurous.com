Instagram has been a powerful motivating force in our family&#8217;s journey towards our dreams.

For us, it&#8217;s become a gallery into a world of possibilities. A canvas of sorts for us to share our own dreams and aspirations.

Recently, I caught this video by Jason Silva on Shots of Awe.

&#8220;You&#8217;re given a chance to decide how this moment will be remembered,&#8221; he says in the video. &#8220;We all become artists, we all become architects of our mental narratives, of our historical digital paper-trail. We decide who we are. We&#8217;re building maps, and those maps are subjective. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a bad thing. &#8230; I think it liberates our desire to be artists.&#8221;

This got me thinking about how Instagram doesn&#8217;t just shape your own reality but can start to shape others as well, as it has for us.

For the last two years we&#8217;ve followed dozens of people who are living a life we only dreamed of. The continuous stream of photos and moments captured have inspired us to dream bigger for ourselves.

Every new photo of someplace beautiful, or a landscape with an Airstream, fanned the flames of deep desire within our hearts to live the nomadic life.

Not only has it inspired us, it has connected us with other people who are doing the thing we dreamed about doing.

If we&#8217;re not already connected on Instagram, go ahead and follow and we&#8217;ll give a follow back.
