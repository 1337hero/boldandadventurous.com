  Of all the steps we are taking in our attempt to live a bold and adventurous life, purging the unneeded stuff from our lives is by far the most fun and challenging.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  We&#8217;ve always considered ourselves minimalists. We purge the house every year, but as we&#8217;ve increased square footage, we&#8217;ve still increased possessions. You know how it is. More room creates a need to fill the empty space. Guest room, bedroom, office, workout room, living room, dining room, and a two car garage certainly had their fill. The thing I&#8217;m most thankful for is Mike uses the garage to park two cars and store car parts, tools, and man stuff. So it&#8217;s not full of useless crap like so many garages in our neighborhood.

  But where to start?<!--more-->
</p>

### 1. Make a Plan and Stick to it! {.p1}

<p class="p1">
  Tomorrow is the land of opportunity, according to a procrastinator. Without a plan, goals are unobtainable. So we made a plan. Sure, it was just a rough plan at first, but it gave us the constraints within which to work. It was simple: tow rig by August, Airstream by October, on the road by January 2015. With a timeline in place, now we know what we need to sell and when, especially to start building our funds up even more!
</p>

### 2. Organize! {.p1}

<img class="alignnone wp-image-78 size-medium" src="http://boldandadventurous.com/_media/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-29-at-2.57.58-PM1-229x300.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-06-29 at 2.57.58 PM" width="229" height="300" />

<p class="p1">
   I work at Basecamp, so we&#8217;ve made incredible use of Basecamp to manage our life and goals. We have several projects going from &#8220;Mission Airstream&#8221;, &#8220;Sell Our Crap&#8221;, &#8220;Places We Want to Go&#8221;, and &#8220;Bold and Adventurous (the blog)&#8221;. Sell Our Crap has been vital to organizing what we need to sell, where we need to sell it, how much, and post any miscellaneous links to listings. It&#8217;s also a great way to go back see what we&#8217;ve already accomplished! There&#8217;s definitely great satisfaction in checking off these items. <img src="http://boldandadventurous.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
</p>

### 3. Stick to your guns! {.p1}

<img class="alignnone wp-image-79 size-medium" src="http://boldandadventurous.com/_media/2014/06/thumbnail1-225x300.jpg" alt="thumbnail" width="225" height="300" />

<p class="p1">
  Keep it? Purge it? What&#8217;s a person to do? So we ask ourselves:
</p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">
    will we need it in the Airstream?
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    will it fit in the Airstream?
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    if no to the above, do we *need* it now? (Do we need to guest bed? No! Do we need the couches? Maybe&#8230;.. Do we need the baby swing? Yes!)
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="p1">
  When it comes to buying new items we always ask:
</p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">
    will we use it in the Airstream?
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    is it something you can live without?
  </li>
</ul>

### 4. Be quick about it! {.p1}

<p class="p1">
  The more time you spend sorting through your stuff, the more emotional and mental energy you&#8217;re putting into the item. Often you&#8217;ll be less inclined to get rid of it then. If you can&#8217;t make a decision in 3 seconds, put the item in another pile to be dealt with after you&#8217;ve finished going through that room. When you&#8217;re done, go back to the pile and make your decisions quickly. At this point, you may be so tired that you&#8217;re just ready to get rid of the whole pile anyway <img src="http://boldandadventurous.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
</p>

### 5. Keep It, Sell It, Donate It {.p1}

<p class="p1">
  KEEP: Things you use consistently and would need to purchase again.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  SELL: A lot of what&#8217;s in your home is worth something to someone else, so leverage it! Sell it on Craigslist, eBay, or a garage sale. If you&#8217;re not pressed for time, ask for what the item is worth. If you&#8217;re pressed for time, price to sell!
</p>

<p class="p1">
  &#8211; eBay
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Shipable items that have enough value you aren&#8217;t cringing when eBay takes their fee. Well, you may cringe anyway. In our case, Apple electronics, high-end car parts, and other notable items were eBay sellers.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  &#8211; Craigslist
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Items that are worth a bit more like couches, tables, beds, bigger electronics (tv/sound system), and aren&#8217;t easily shipped do very well on Craigslist. We weren&#8217;t in a hurry to sell our items, so we priced them fairly. Some items went within hours of posting, other items took a few weeks for the right buyer to find us.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  &#8211; Garage Sale
</p>

<p class="p1">
  We&#8217;ve yet to hold a garage sale. That will come when the Airstream arrives. Kitchen items, misc housewares, furniture, and basically everything else that hasn&#8217;t sold will be offered here. It may take a full weekend, it may take a couple weekends, but we&#8217;re in the perfect area for late fall sales.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  DONATE: Some items just aren&#8217;t worth the effort of listing, but they may be helpful to someone else. We&#8217;ve got a ton of books we&#8217;ve given to family members, and the office supplies we don&#8217;t need have been donated to a family member&#8217;s small church. Other items, like tools we don&#8217;t need, will be given to various family members as well. Whatever will be leftover in the end that we can&#8217;t get a nickel or dime for will be taken to the local Salvation Army or Goodwill. This stuff doesn&#8217;t belong in landfills if someone else can benefit from it.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  In the end, we plan to be left with less than we need. Leaves more room for the right things.
