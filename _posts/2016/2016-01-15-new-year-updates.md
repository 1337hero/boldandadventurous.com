It's 2016 and with that just a few updates. I'm working on an major update to our blog and website for the new year. So over the next few weeks there will be some changes around here. And we are launching a youtube channel soon too.

**Lithiums** - YES, we finished the install. I was planning to post part 2 but had to bump up the timeframe on phase 2. So I'd had to rewrite a portion of my posts detailing our install since I have added new components. A new post and video will be out by the end of the month.

**Anza Borrego** - We had a great time hanging our with friends in Anza for the new years.
