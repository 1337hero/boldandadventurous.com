Hard to believe, we're already half way through the first month of 2016! We had so much fun over the holidays hanging out with friends in Anza Borrego and at American Girl Mine. 

We just wanted to share a quick update about the status of things. I am working on an major update to our blog and website for the new year. I expect the project to be completed by the end of Janurary. And we are attempting to catch up on A LOT of blog posts. We've visited a lot of places this year, and done number of serious upgrades to our Airstream. We've shared hints on Facebook & Instagram and have received a lot of emails about it. So hopefully soon we can start sharing here.

**Lithiums** - YES, we finished the install. I was planning to post part 2 but had to bump up the timeframe on phase 2. So I'd had to rewrite a portion of my posts detailing our install since I have added new components. A new post and video will be out by the end of the month.

We'll have more good news coming up at the start of February with some changes to our work and personal lives.
