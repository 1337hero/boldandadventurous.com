With all the boondocking we love to do, those trips to the dump were becoming a real drag. My least favorite activity is personal time with the ol' stinky slinky.

So a few months ago we started talking about composting our poo. And last week we decided to purchase a Natures Head composting toilet. What's a composting toilet, and why would we ever do such a thing? 


## Leveled up Boondocking

A dry composting toilet uses zero water, so no more wasting your fresh water with every flush. That also means no need to buy and dump chemicals into your black tank.

The system is natural and self-sufficient.  The toilet is like a mini ecosystem that separates the liquids (your pee) and the solids (your poo). This allows the solids to compost into humus.  Returning humus to the soil is no different than adding animal manure to the soil.

For boondocking this is a huge win. No more flushing fresh water down the drain! If we're staying someplace we enjoy, our time there won't be limited by the need to dump our black tank. And no more spending money on black tank chemicals.

The biggest benefit of all though is to the environment.

## How does it work?

We purchased a Natures Head composting toilet. We chose this brand after some research and hearing comments from others who owned one.

As stated above, the toilet separates liquids and solids into two separate compartments. 

Pee is diverted via these two holes up front into a 2.2-gallon jug at the front of the unit. You can easily remove this and dump it when it's full.

Poo is diverted into the composting bin. When it's time to go #2 you just open the flap, and your "stuff" drops right in.

On the side, there is an agitator handle. After each use, just give it a couple of turns and it will mix the compost. The bacteria will do the rest of the work.

## Does it smell?

NO. 

And we're not lying! The key is separated solids and liquids. They don’t create sewage that way or the odor that emanates from your black tank.  Inside the solids tank is peat moss or coconut COIR, which smells like dirt.  There’s also a fan inside the tank that directs the air, along with any smells, outside while keeping the moisture down inside the solid tank.

## Our installation

This article is not a how-to or instructional but just how we did things.

This installation should be easy for most RV owners. Since there is no plumbing involved, you only need to worry about an exhaust vent hose and 12v power supply.

We have a 2007 Airstream International Signature 27 foot front bedroom model. So everything following is in relation to our Airstream.

We started by removing our Dometic 310 toilet. It was secured to the flange with two 1/2 inch nuts. Then we closed off the toilet flange to the black tank. A 3-inch repair plug will work for this.

After that was out of the way, I proceeded to clean the floor and wall. No one wants to work in a dirty workspace.

In the 27ft FB, we have a fake wall in the left corner next to the toilet that is hiding the black tank vent. We removed this wall to expose the vent pipe.

Our flange sat just about 1/4 of an inch above our floor tiling. For us to set the new composting toilet level on the floor, I needed to use a piece of plywood.

So I cut a piece of wood and did my best to cut a circle for the flange. Not my best work, but it will work for our purpose.

I also decided to cap off my toilet supply line using a 1/2 inch SharkBite End Stop.

Needless to say, the Natures Head toilet is a lot larger than the Dometic 310 it was replacing. To make sure we had room for comfortable positioning and proper operation we had to angle the toilet slightly towards the door. We marked our mounting base for installation of the mounting brackets, installed them and then stained our wood.

The mounting brackets allow you to easily remove the base of the toilet to empty the solids compartment when needed.

If you are installing one of these, make sure you take measurements. It's a tight fit in the 27ft Airstream FB but still workable. 

I connected our vent to the black tank vent using a 1 1/2 inch PVC tee and connected my vent hose to it. 

Wiring the 12v was the easiest for us. Our house batteries are behind the wall of the bathroom. So all we had to do was route the wire through the wall.

After that, I re-installed our false wall covering the black tank vent.

The last thing to do was prep our composting medium. You can use either peat moss or coconut COIR. We chose Coconut COIR as it's sustainable and environmentally friendly.

JorDanee had the pleasure of prepping the Coconut COIR. It comes in a big dehydrated bag. So we needed to break some of it off and rehydrate it for our toilet.

Once it was ready, we placed it in the toilet. We used just enough to fill up just below the agitator per the instructions.

## Initial Impressions

WE LOVE IT! It's true people like what they have, but this has been a fun experience. Our first uses have been trouble free. Zero smells and no problems.

I'll be honest; I was just a tad concerned I'll be cleaning the bowl from some streaks. Not the case. Everything just "drops" right in the hole when you go to drop one (pun intended). 

**The end result:**

We'll do a follow-up post in a month or two and let you know how life has been with a composting toilet. 

Until then, thanks for reading!
