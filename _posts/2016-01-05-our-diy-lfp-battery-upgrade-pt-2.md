I had done a lot of research already leading up to the purchase. And decided we'd build out our system in three phases. 

But as I stated in Part 1, we needed batteries NOW. So the first phase of this project would focus on getting us up and running with lithiums. So over thanksgiving I picked up the 4 batteries, sense boards and BMS from Starlight Solar in Yuma.

Our planned three phases are as follows:

### Phase 1
* Install 400Ah of lithium batteries
* Installation of 300 Amp fuse bus for Inverter
* Installation of 50 Amp breaker to isolate Airstream's 12V 
* Installation of Inteli-Power® PD9145AL 45-amp lithium ion converter/charger
* Installation of 4th - 100 watt solar panel on roof
* Upgrade Solar Charge Controller to Blue Sky Energy SB3024IL
* Upgrade wiring from combiner box to solar charge controller with 4 AWG



### Phase 2
* Slave old Blue Sky Energy 2512iX to SB3024IL
* Install SAE Port on side of Airstream
* DIY a 200-watt ground deploy solar panel using two GS100 panels from Grape Solar.

### Phase 3 
* Upgrade 600-watt inverter to Magnum 3000 watt Hybrid Inverter
* Installation of secondary AC panel to separate fridge

We honestly don't have a need for this much power, but we are interested in using our A/C with the lithiums. This will allow us the use of our A/C for 2.5hrs on the lithium bank or all day when combined with our Honda generator.

# Solar Re-Wire and New Panel

The first thing I did after getting the supplies we needed was to install our new 100 watt grape solar panel and upgrade the wiring from the combiner box.

We already had 405 watts in the form of three 135-watt panels on the roof. The new panel would bring our roof solar up to 505 watts.

New Panel installed

Installing the new 4 AWG wire.

My cable run to the charge controller is pretty short. It runs down the back of the bathroom here:


And will pop out right next to the batteries.


# Building The Battery Box

Lithiums don’t like the cold or extreme heat. So they are best installed inside. I decided to place ours inside , at the front of the curb side twin near the bathroom wall.

The first thing I did was determine the layout of the batteries. And take some measurements. 

Next I removed the steel bands and plates that hold the cells together. These are in place to prevent the batteries from swelling, but that won't be a problem since I am installing them in a tight fighting box.

I built my battery box out of 1x6x6 and 1x1x4 select pine. The battery box is approximately 5 1/2 inches from the Airstream curbside wall. And is secured to the floor with screws.

After building the box, the next step was to install the sense boards and terminal connectors.

After I installed the sense boards, I proceeded to wire my batteries into parallel with my wire. Originally I planned to use copper bar, but every place I found online that sells it had long ship times. So I might come back in the future and replace the 2/0 with a copper bar all the way down the connectors.

On the wall here I mounted a piece of 1/4 sanded plywood to mount things too. The first thing I mounted and wired was the Shunt. The shunt is wired off the negative terminal opposite of the bank from the positive terminal.

I decided this would be where both my solar charge controller and BMS (battery management system) would be placed. Along with the fuse breaker for the solar and the solar master on/off switch.

I then constructed a lid for the top of the battery box, that just sits a few inches above it. It does not cover the entire box, and leaves one end open for temperature control.

Also I planned to use the top to mount most of the positive side pieces.

Off the positive side terminal, my batteries go to a 12v continuous duty solenoid. The solenoid is controlled by the BMS, and when it stops receiving 12v it closes. Removing the battery bank from the system and protecting it from over charge and under voltage situations.

From the solenoid the power flows to a master On/Off switch, and from there to a terminal stud. From the lead there is a 300amp fused bus bar for the inverter all 2awg wire. The 2awg wire leads from the stud to the Airstream’s power distribution bus.

I took the opportunity to rewire the Airstreams power distribution bus and isolate the Airstream with a 50amp breaker switch. I installed a second ground bar, as the original was over loaded and two new bus bars for things that are isolated outside the Airstreams disconnect.
