It&#8217;s January. I want to be out of the house and in the Airstream by the end of March. Why? Because Baby #2 is due the last week of March/first week of April.

I honestly don&#8217;t care if we&#8217;re on the road full time at that point or not. I just want to be out of this house and in my silver home. I want to sit back and enjoy being a new mom and watching Alex learn to be a big sister. I want to be available for Alex as she transitions from being the only kid to being the older kid. I don&#8217;t want to spend maternity leave knee deep in yard sales or packing stuff up for donation. I don&#8217;t want to be cleaning the house for the next set of tenants and caring for two kids under two. And I certainly don&#8217;t want to be doing all that while recovering from a c-section.

We&#8217;ve already sold most of the big furniture except for couches, a couple dressers, a bed, and two standing desks. The spare bedroom has become a dumping ground as we clear out everything we don&#8217;t need or can&#8217;t use in the Airstream, and boy! Is it full of stuff! We&#8217;ve always considered ourselves minimalists, but looking at all this stuff&#8230; I just have to remind myself that even minimalists have some pruning to do when downsizing from ~2200 sq ft to ~180 sq ft.. I&#8217;m just impatient to have it all gone now.

We also have a two car garage, and over the two years we&#8217;ve been in this house, we&#8217;ve amassed a few car parts/accessories. Some of these will go with us, like the jerry cans we use to carry extra fuel when overlanding. Some of these things won&#8217;t go with us, like the rims and 35&#8243; mud tires from our adventure mobile. But yet, nothing will happen in the garage until Mike finds time to get it done. I realize he commutes to an office and spends evenings working on side projects. Weekends are spent working on the Airstream and Air Rig. I don&#8217;t say it enough: I truly appreciate the man I married. I&#8217;m just impatient to see that garage cleared out.

I&#8217;ve come to realize my impatience has put me in a bad spot mentally and emotionally. It&#8217;s leading to frustration and anger which turns me into a brooding wife and mother. It&#8217;s not fair to Mike or Alex. It&#8217;s not fair to myself, and I can imagine it&#8217;s not fair to the little girl growing inside me.

Back in the early Spring of 2010, I was in a similar situation. I was months away from graduating with my Masters and focused on looking for full-time work. I spent hours and hours each day searching job posts, submitting my resum√©, and talking with recruiters. Then graduation came and still no job offer. Thankfully someone granted an extension on my paid internship while I continued to search for work.

It was a frustrating time though. Things weren&#8217;t going how I wanted them to go, and the economy wasn&#8217;t helping. But somehow I just knew that I would get the job I wanted. I held onto that belief despite all the negativity around me. Then miracles of miracles, two offers came in within 4 days of each other, and the second offer was for the job we were hoping I&#8217;d get. By September of that year, we were living in Florida, and I was doing what I wanted to do.

It feels that way all over again. I know where I want to be. I&#8217;m just impatient for it to happen. Somehow, our material possessions have started to feel like chains, tying us down. It&#8217;s a frustrating time for me, but I know at the end of all this, I&#8217;ll be sitting in my silver home living the life I want. I just need to focus on that end goal and remind myself that where we are is temporary. Where we&#8217;re going will be worth it.
