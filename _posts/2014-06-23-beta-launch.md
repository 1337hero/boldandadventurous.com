May of 2013 I purchased this domain when my wife and I had our original idea of selling all our crap, buying an Airstream and starting this site. Well, for reasons that I&#8217;ll detail in the next post, that didn&#8217;t happen.

We&#8217;ve been writing articles and fussing about getting the site up, but as a web developer, I&#8217;m extremely picky about my site. Sometimes you are your own most difficult client. I haven&#8217;t been able to make my mind up about the design and layout for anything.

But, since we started moving towards our goals, we decided to just launch the site in a beta fashion. To get our ideas out there and start sharing with others who can help hold us accountable as we accomplish of our dreams.

I&#8217;ve decided to leave design and other fancy features for later.
