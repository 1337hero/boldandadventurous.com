If you have been following us for awhile you might know about the Works. Thatâ€™s Josh, Jessa, Jack and sometimes Cody. For while they traveled the country in their Airstream before settling down in Kanas.

Last year the Works got featured in an issue of the online magazine Dark Rye. A documentary film team joined them for a month at their campground in Oregon.

What came out of that session was nothing short of spectacular. It elegantly captured the essence of why people like us decided to leave the norm and pursue something out of the ordinary.
