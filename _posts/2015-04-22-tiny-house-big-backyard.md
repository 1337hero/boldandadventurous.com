We're only 8 days away from leaving Florida, for our full-time adventure, living in a tiny house, with a big backyard.

That tiny house is of course our 2007 Airstream International Signature. And that big backyard, is all of America. Working on getting all our travel materials online for friends and family and curious onlookers.

It's been a busy past few weeks while we head towards the finish line, and hasn't left much time for our social media presence. But just wanted to update the blog, and hint at some future self branding.

Cheers.
