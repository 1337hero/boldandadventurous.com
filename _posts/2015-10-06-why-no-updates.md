We've been on the road for over 150 days. But you're probably wondering why we haven't updated our website? Well, life mostly. These 150 days have been full of fun and learning. And we've been more active on [Instagram][1] & [Facebook][2]. If you want to know what we've been up to, you'll find us there.

With that being said, I do hope to update our blog in the next few weeks with some new content, especially since I've been getting a lot of questions on [Instagram][1] about our Airstream setup.

Until then.
