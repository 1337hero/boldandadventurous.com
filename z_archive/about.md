title: About Us - We're Bold and Adventurous!
---


Hi, we are the Key family.  We are a family of four living, working & exploring the USA in our Airstream. 

We grew tired of the rat race and living for the weekends. So we took a bold step in a new direction with our lives. We traded in the American Dream for a simpler more fulfilled life. One full of adventure, new places, new experiences and new friendships.

And we haven't looked back. 

## THE BLOG

We created this blog for you; our trusted friends.  To share our stories, adventures, and lessons from the road. From the gear we use to the places we go and the friends, we meet along the way. 

If you're considering a bold new direction in life; and stepping outside your comfort zone, we want you to see you can live your dreams too.

Our hope is that by sharing our knowledge and experience you can benefit.

## US

We're minimalists, eat paleo and are unashamed sci-fi nerds. If you want to play Scrabble, Uno or Settlers of Catan we are *game*. 

But our hearts most come alive outside. Whether it's hiking, mountain biking, kayaking or off-roading in Moab. We are on the look out for adventure and exciting places to visit and things to do.
