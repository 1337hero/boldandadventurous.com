title: Bold & Adventurous is a way of looking at life. It's about getting outside our comfort zone, taking action and achieving our dreams.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>We&#8217;re two young rebels raising a family who grew tired of the rat race and traded in the American Dream<br /> </strong><strong>of </strong><b>consumerism and living for the weekend for a simpler more fulfilled life full of adventure and new experiences.</b>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  We&#8217;re pushing ourselves to get outside our comfort zone, taking action and achieving our dreams.<br /> We&#8217;re living life boldly and confidently in pursuit of our dreams, adventure, and personal growth<br /> &#8212; striving to build a great life and become the best possible versions of ourselves.

  THE BLOG
</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  We created this blog to motivate ourselves to step outside our comfort zone and achieve our dreams. We believe we can achieve our dreams by being intentional, taking action, and overcoming negative beliefs with positive ones.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  We value strength, courage, determination, intentionality, positivity and <strong>boldness</strong> above all else.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  We don&#8217;t ask what the meaning of life is &#8212; we just define the meaning of life through our choices and actions. We believe in creating our own destiny.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  On this blog, you&#8217;ll find us discussing topics relating to our lifestyle and how we accomplish things. Along the way we&#8217;ll share our stories of adventure, new friends, our failures and our successes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  We hope that we can encourage and inspire others.
